# Hello, welcome to my profile!

![Hunger_Games_Nile](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c320707-af21-4cce-900a-a8e44e9fb067)

Hi, I’m <b>EnderNile8182</b>, or <b>Rivulet Nil</b>, but you can call me <b>Nile</b>!<br><br>
I'm an italian artist, pixel artist, beginner animator and gamer with an interest in coding.<br>

## Interests
As an artist, obviously art. I'm particularly interested in digital illustrations and environment art, but I also enjoy OC art (Original-Characters/Own-Characters) and pixel art.<br>
I am also interested in animation, though I am only able to do simple sprite animations as of now.<br><br>

As a gamer, I'm sucker for platformer games and rhythm-based ones. I also enjoy many coop-typed games and ones with a peculiar or cutesy artstyle/graphics.<br>
I'd love to one day develop my own game.

## Contacts
You can contact me on Instagram (@endernile8182) or Discord (@nile8182), though the latter would be preferrable. ^^
You can also find me in different communities, such as the FNF one where I create mods and the Geometry Dash one.
